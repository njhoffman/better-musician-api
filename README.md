NodeJS RESTful API server for handling requests from [better-musician-api](https://github.com/njhoffman/better-musician-api).

**Core Technology Stack**

* [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io/) - Transpiler for proposed ES6 syntax features.
* [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) - Web framework for handling HTTP interactions.
* [RethinkDB](https://www.rethinkdb.com) - NoSQL database based on ReSQL syntax.

**Key Deveopment Tools**

* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - Linter (syntax/format checker) supporting ES6
* [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - Test framework for running unit and end-to-end tests

Based on the [templates-api](https://github.com/njhoffman/templates-api) core framework. Will be eventually included as a submodule with an eject script to deploy core files.
